I later expanded its functionality to include a photo gallery, an infinite news feed, a client sign-up form, and an interactive language quiz.<br/><br/>After leaving Premium Faber, I continued working directly with Extra-English. Recently, I implemented user authentication, lesson management and attendance tracking, and automated payment calculations.</p>"
